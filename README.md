# Text_and_image_generation_using_models


It showcases the process of generating images from text prompts using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The workflow involves leveraging a pre-trained language model for text generation and an image generation API.

Steps:
Text Generation Pipeline:

Utilized the transformers library's high-level text generation pipeline.
Defined a prompt, generating creative and contextually relevant text using the Bloom language model.
Text Prompt Generation:

Developed a custom function for text prompt generation with a specified model.
Saved the generated prompt to a text file for later use.
Image Generation with API:

Employed an image generation API to transform the generated text prompt into a visual representation.
Displayed the resulting image in the notebook.
